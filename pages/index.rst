        Language technology groups at `UiT/The Arctic University of Norway <uit.no>`_

        `Divvun <http://divvun.no>`_ develops proofing tools and language technology for minority and indigenous languages

        `Giellatekno <http://giellatekno.uit.no>`_ specialises in language technology and research on Sámi and other circumpolar and minority languages


Language technology only exists for a handful of languages today. Most of the world’s 7,000 languages are without access to such tools. This goes especially for languages with a complex grammatical structure and without access to huge text collections — meaning almost all indigenous languages. This excludes us from the digitalised modern society as the technical solutions used by the majority languages are not available for our languages. We can overcome this digital divide by building language tools for languages that do not have access of the methods of the industry.

Tools (in increasing complexity)
================================

* Computer keyboards
* Mobile phone keyboards
* Word analysers
* Dictionaries with grammars
* Spelling checkers
* Mobile phone keyboars w/ spelling checkers
* Word form generation
* Hyphenation
* Language learning tools
* Grammar checkers
* Machine translation

No language is too hard for language technology
-----------------------------------------------

All letters of our indigenous languages are accessible to all computers and mobile phones via Unicode and grammars can be modelled in a way the computer understands.

There is no quick fix for this — good models and tools require much work. This work must be done by each language community (in cooperation with linguists and programmers). Just  waiting for Google or someone else outside the language community to fix it is not an option.

Different language communities and users need different tools, for various reasons. Most languages will still need to be processed by computers in some way. Language technology may strengthen literacy and the use of the language in new domains. Being able to type our languages on all devices is the first — and also an easy — step.

We have made all the tools mentioned above for most Sámi languages. Using this infrastructure,  other communities have made similar tools available for indigenous languages in Canada and Russia. All the solutions free and open source. Everyone can now do what we have done.

How to do it?
-------------

The GiellaLT infrastructure used by Divvun and Giellatekno provides a language independent framework for building a grammatical model of each language. The infrastructure takes the model and turns it into computer programs and useful tools for the language community. All the technical labour to make the tools work in MS Office, Windows, on the Mac and elsewhere is done separate of the linguistic work, and each language community can concentrate on the grammatical model.
